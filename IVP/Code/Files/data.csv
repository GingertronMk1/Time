Although Chekhov intended it as a comedy/ and it does contain some elements of farce/ Stanislavski insisted on directing the play as a tragedy. Since this initial production/ directors have had to contend with the dual nature of the play. The play is often identified on the short list of the three or four outstanding plays written by Chekhov along with The Seagull/ Three Sisters/ and Uncle Vanya.\n\nThe play concerns an aristocratic Russian woman and her family as they return to their family estate (which includes a large and well-known cherry orchard) just before it is auctioned to pay the mortgage. While presented with options to save the estate/ the family essentially does nothing and the play ends with the sale of the estate to the son of a former serf; the family leaves to the sound of the cherry orchard being cut down. The story presents themes of cultural futility‚ both the futile attempts of the aristocracy to maintain its status and of the bourgeoisie to find meaning in its newfound materialism. In reflecting the socio-economic forces at work in Russia at the turn of the 20th century/ including the rise of the middle class after the abolition of serfdom in the mid-19th century and the sinking of the aristocracy/ the play reflects forces at work around the globe in that period.\n,NA,NA,The Cherry Orchard is the last play by Russian playwright Anton Chekhov.

Janis Bryan/ ,The Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman)/ usually referred to simply as Everyman/ is a late 15th-century morality play. Like John Bunyan’s 1678 Christian novel The Pilgrim’s Progress/ Everyman uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one’s life will be tallied by God after death/ as in a ledger book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman/ who represents all mankind. In the course of the action/ Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical/ each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship/ (material) Goods/ and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatised by the interactions between characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone/ despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him. Everyman learns that when you are brought to death and placed before God all you are left with is your own good deeds.\n,NA,NA,The Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman)/ usually referred to simply as Everyman/ is a late 15th-century morality play.

The three women teachers mutually pledge to abstain from sexual intercourse/ in protest against the dominance and abusive treatment of women by men/ epitomized in the slur against women as “slags.” Conflicts among the teachers’ different visions of radical feminism/ different motivations/ and different interpretations of and commitment to the vow become the grist for duplicitous dominant and abusive acts among them and distracts them from their teaching.

John Thewlis/ ,The Country Wife is a Restoration comedy written in 1675 by William Wycherley. A product of the tolerant early Restoration period/ the play reflects an aristocratic and anti-Puritan ideology/ and was controversial for its sexual explicitness even in its own time. The title itself contains a lewd pun. It is based on several plays by Molière/ with added features that 1670s London audiences demandedcolloquial prose dialogue in place of Molière’s verse/ a complicated/ fast-paced plot tangle/ and many sex jokes. It turns on two indelicate plot devicesa rake’s trick of pretending impotence to safely have clandestine affairs with married women/ and the arrival in London of an inexperienced young “country wife”/ with her discovery of the joys of town life/ especially the fascinating London men.\n\nThe scandalous trick and the frank language have for much of the play’s history kept it off the stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924/ The Country Wife was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick’s cleaned-up and bland version The Country Girl/ now a forgotten curiosity.
