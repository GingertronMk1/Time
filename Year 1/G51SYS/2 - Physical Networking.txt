    Linking Computers
        Already saw this at one level in previous notes
        Breadboard computer sent all its IO to the laptop
        Traditionally done using a serial links
            Link is RS232
                Transmit Pin connected to Recieve Pin
                Recieve Pin connected to Transmit Pin
                Ground Pin connected to Ground Pin
                Tends to be used for point-to-point links
                Serial transfer
                Both ends need to be configured the same
                Asynchronous - Doesn't have to wait to send data
                Sends from the least significant bit (right-most binary character)
                Uses +15V for 0 and -15V for 1
            Within a serial terminal program
        
    Serial vs Parallel
        Saw previously how CPU transfers memory to and from memory
        Transferred in 8-bit chunks - 8 separate wires
        Alternative is to send them serially, or one by one
        Most networks work serially
            Needs fewer wires for the same bit width
            Less of a bottleneck
            God damn speed of light laws of physics bullshit
            Hardware needs to know about the formatting
                First bit?
                Number of bits?
                How fast are they being sent?
        Shift registers essentially convert from parallel to serial and back again

    Sending multiple characters
        Sending an A over RS232
            Sends binary 65, 01000001
            RS232 sends it like 10000010
            If we need to send 2 A's, we need a defined start and end point
            If we don't have that, we can send entirely different numbers, and therefore entirely different messages
            As well as sending the first bit of the message, RS232 also sends a first-er bit, a 0. Always.
                Then sends a final stop bit after the messages, which is always a 1
                The line remains at 1 if no characters are being transmitted
                Sometimes this doesn't quite work and we get a framing error

    Duplex
        RS232 is full duplex
            Computer can send and recieve at the same time
            Doesn't have to wait for other computer to finish before you start
            Half duplex is when only one thing can talk at a time
                eg WiFi, early Ethernet

    Modulation/Demodulation
        We haven't discussed how bits go along the wire
        RS232 uses voltages, but that only works for short distances
        Continuously oscillating signals can go much farther
        Comm systems tend to use a continuous oscillatinf signal as a data carrier
        Various types
            Amplitude (AM)
            Frequency (FM)
            Phase-Shift
        Some methods can modulate more than one signal
        Hardware based modulators/demodulators interpret the signal
            Called modems (ah!)
