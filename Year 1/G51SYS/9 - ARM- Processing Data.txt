9 - ARM: Processing Data

    LDR
        Two operands: register and address
        Places the 32-bit value stored at address in the register
        Not to be confused with ADR
            LDR gets the value stored, ADR the address
        Can be suffixed to form LDRB which loads an 8-bit byte

    Load/Store Architecture
        ARM is this kind of CPU
        Means that memory can only be read/written by load and store (LDR and STR) operations
        Other CPUs will let other instructions access memory as well
        ARM separates data processing instructions from memory access

    STR
        The exact same as LDR except stores instead of reads

    Data Processing Instructions
        Only operate on registers
        Common maths and logic operations
        Either two or three operands
            Destination register then one or two source registers
        Last source register can optionally be an immediate value (a number)
        Usually of the form
            ADD Rd, Rn, Op2
            Destination is Rd
            Both Rd and Rn must be registers (can be the same)
            Op2 can be an immediate value or another register (which can be shifted)

    Immediate Values
        Every instruction is 32-bits wide in ARM
        This includes the immediate value and the bits used to describe the instruction
        Ends up with only 12 bits available for the immediate value
            Immediate values are encoded as an 8-bit value (0-255) and a 4-bit rotation value
            Rotation shifts the bits around the 32-bits of the register

    Conditional Branch
        Branch as per B only if the condition is true
            What condition?
        There's a thing called the CPSR (Current Program Status Register)
        The condition is based on the state of the CPSR
        Certain instructions can set flags on the CPSR depending on their results
            The instruction requires an 'S' suffix 
            Apart from TST, TEQ, CMP, and CMN

    CMP
        Operands: 2 source registers
        Calculates Rm-Rn and updates status registers
        If registers are equal, Z flag is set in CPSR
