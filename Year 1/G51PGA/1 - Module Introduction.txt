    First Steps In Programming

    Module Outline
        Aim
            Introduce basic principles of programming & algorithms

        Objectives
            Teach basic programming stuff in C
            Teach theory of algorithms & data structures (code optimisey stuff)
            Get to grips with the various tools used

    Lectures
        Jon does basic C programming topics
        Per Kristian covers more algorithm and theory stuff
        General Qs on moodle, email teachers with more confidential questions
            Expect a reply in 3 working days

        Use the moodle (moodle.nottingham.ac.uk) for announcements, lecture notes etc.

    Labs
        1 2-hour lab every week in A32
            Weekly programming excercises
                Form the basis of coursework assessment
                DO WORK OUTSIDE OF LABS TO BE FINISHED WITHIN LABS

            One of the lecturers will be present + lab assistants

        How learn programming

    Tutorials
        Weekly, learn practical and complementary skills
            Editors, testing, debugging etc

        Later, they'll provide additional help for coursework

    Assessment
        Coursework: 75%
            CW-A: Weeks 2-5:  15%
            CW-B: Weeks 6-12: 60%
            Broken down into weekly excercises
                In each lab week 3-12 you get marks worth 5% and instant feedback
                    Grand total of 50% marked in labs

                Complete portfolio of work for CW-B to be handed in via moodle by 11/12/15
                    Marked for 25%, marks and feedback given 11/01/16

        Exam (2 hour): 25%
            More theory stuff like algorithm design
            Details and practise Qs given out in week 12

    Introduction
        Computers are stupid
            You need to tell them specifically what you want them to do
            Hence, programming

    Drawing a square
        Declarative
            Describe the box

        Imperative
            Describe how to build the box

        Computers are naturally imperative, but we can use declarative options

    Breakdown
        Break the problem down into small exact steps
        Tell the computer how to perform those steps

    High-Level
        Computers only understand machine code (binary, basically)
        People don't
        We write in languages like C and convert (compile) that into machine code

    The hell is a program?
        A sequence of instructions
        The computer will execute them one by one
        Each instruction normally does one little thing
        They act on data
        Together they build up to some really complex tasks
        Algorithm (How to do stuff) + Data (what to do the stuff on)

    Types of instructions
        Maths operations
        Variables
        Conditionals
        Loops
        Procedures (functions)

    Counting characters in a piece of text
        Variable for the value you're after
        Knowledge of where we are
        What kind of data we're using and creating
        Where to start and end
