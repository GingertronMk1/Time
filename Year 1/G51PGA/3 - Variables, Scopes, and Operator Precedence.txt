    Printf
        Print formatted
        Takes one or more parameters
            A string of text to print
            A series of values to interpolate into that string
        Regular characters are printed as normal
        Special characters
            Interpolation strings
                %d, %f, %s
                    Double, float, string
                    Strings interpolated need to be in quotation marks
                Possible to specify print length by adding a number after the %
                    Doesn't truncate longer strings
            Escaping characters
                \

    Variables and Scopes
        Variables have scope
            This means they can only be accessed from certain parts of a program
        Thus far, we've only looked at local variables
            Ones that exist only within the functions they're declared in
                Not accessible to funcitons called from that function
            Their values aren't carried to the next time the function runs
                Created when the function runs, destroyed when it stops
        You can have global variables
            Ones that are available to the whole program
            These aren't limited to one function
            They're defined at the top level of a program, before main
            Some people consider them to be bad practice, along with gotos

    Parameters
        These allow us to pass values from one function to another
        Work similarly to local variables
            Scope is limited to that function
        Value gets assigned when the program's called
        Value can be changed exactly like a variable
        The original calling value cannot be changed
            The variable in the function is a separate copy

    Return values
        Functions can return values as well as take in parameters
        This uses the return statement, which finishes the function and retrns to the calling
            routine
