(G51MCS) 1 - Set Theory

Bob John

    Why and What
        Why?
            Computers do stuff with data structures
                Lists
                    Trees
                    Files

            Sets make it easier to add to/take from these collections
            Models of software rely on SET THEORY and LOGIC

        What?
            A collection of things
            We can describe a set by listing stuff in it
                Letters = {a,b,c,d,...,x,y,z}
                N = {0,1,2,3,...}

            The order doesn't matter
            Defining a set is like defining an array, just with braces not brackets
                Alternately, we can define a set by a condition
                    X = {x|x%3=0}
                    Notts = {s|s is a student at UoN}
                        Where | is called a constraint bar

            A set has no duplicate elements
                Something is either a member of a set or it isn't. It cannot be a member twice.

            2 sets are equal ONLY IF THEY HAVE THE SAME ELEMENTS
                If 2 sets have the same elements they are equal
                If 2 sets are equal they have the same elements

            2 standard sets
                Natural Numbers = {0,1,2,3,...}
                Integers = {...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...}
                Subranges are certain parts within a set
                    a..b = {x|x is within Integers and a≤x≤b}
                    e.g. 5..10 = {5,6,7,8,9,10}

    Set Operation
        2 sets
            A = {a,b,c,d,e}
            B = {d,e,f,g}

        Union, ∪
            A ∪ B = {a,b,c,d,e,f,g}
            A set with all elements of A and B
            A OR B

        Intersection, ∩
            A ∩ B = {d,e}
            A set containing only elements that are in A and B
            A AND B
            Works with as many sets as you want

        Subtraction, \
            A\B = {a,b,c}
            A set containing the elements in A that aren't in B

    Venn Diagrams
        The middle bit is the intersection
        The whole diagram is the union
        
    Size or Cardinality
        For a set S the cardinality is |S| (modulus of S, for the maths geeks)
        A = {a,b,c,d,e}
            |A| = 5

        B = {d,e,f,g}
            |B| = 4

        The Empty Set is defined by either E = {} or E = (phi)

    Excercise
        S = {1,3,5,7,9}
        T = {5,6,7,8,9,10}
            S ∪ T = {1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10}
            S ∩ T = {5,7,9}
            S\T = {1,3}
            T\S = {6,8,10}
            |S| = 5
            |T| = 6

    Subset, ⊂
        A set X is only a subset of Y if AND ONLY IF every member of X is also a member of Y
        4..8 ⊂ {x|x is a member of N and x ≤ 10}
        
    Example
        Let's put together a payroll system
        A systems analyst looks for natural sets that occur
        We may treat certain sets of workers differently
        WORKERS the set of all workers in the company
        This set may be categorised into subsets, MANUAL and ADMIN
        What relationship is there between these subsets?
            MANUAL ∪ ADMIN = WORKERS
        There are at least twice as many manual workers as admin
            |MANUAL| ≥ 2|ADMIN|

    Set Comprehension
        Predicates
            A predicate is a property or properties
                A = {x:N|x ≤ 3}
                Therefore, A = {0,1,2,3}
            We can go further
                b = {x:N| 1≤x≤50·2x}
                b is a set of the first 50 even numbers
                Alternately, we can write it as b = {x:1...50·2x}

        Examples
            C = {y:N|y≤5}
                C = {0,1,2,3,4,5}
            D = {y:N|y≤5·y+3}
                D = {3,4,5,6,7,8}
            E = {t:1...10·t^2}
                E = {1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100}

    Cartesian Product, aka Tuples
        Pairs of values can be created by taking the product of 2 sets, say X and Y
        XxY = {(x,y)|x:X and Y:Y}
        If X = {1,2} and Y = {a,b,c}, we get
            XxY = {(1,a),(1,b),(1,c),(2,a),(2,b),(2,c)}
            The order matters: (1,a) IS DIFFERENT TO (a,1)
        Consider a set of people and their heights. The set NAMExHEIGHT is a set of all possible
        pairs of values
            We can extend to a triple, eg the set NAMExHEIGHTxWEIGHT, which would be
            (name, height, weight)
        |AxB| = |A| x |B|

    Power Set
        For any given set X we can make a set of ALL subsets of X
            This is called the power set of X and is denoted by PX
            eg P{a,b} = {{},{a},{b},{a,b}}
                Cardinality of a power set is equal to 2^n, where n is the cardinality of the set

    Universal and Complement
        The Universal set is the set of all elements in a particular world or problem
            Usuall denoted by X
        The complement of a set P can be denoted by P^c and is all elements in X but not in P

    Symmetric Difference
        The set of elements that belong to A or B, but not both
        Don't bother beyond that

    De Morgans Laws
        (A ∩ B)^c = A^c ∪ B^c
        (A ∪ B)^c = A^c ∩ B^c
