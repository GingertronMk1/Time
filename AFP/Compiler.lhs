Imperative language:

Factorial example:

> fac n = Seqn [Assign 'A' (Val 1),
>               Assign 'B' (Val n),
>               While (Var 'B') (Seqn

MY CODE STARTS HERE:------------------------------------------------------------

TEST CASES:---------------------------------------------------------------------

> testStack = [1,4,6,3]
> testMem :: Mem
> testMem = [('A',5),('B',3),('C',10),('D',0),('E',6)]

>                       If (Var 'B') (fac 10) (fac 2)]

COMPILER CODE:------------------------------------------------------------------

'comp' goes from Prog to Code, where Code = [Inst]
Therefore it goes from Prog -> [Inst]

> comp :: Prog -> Code
> comp p = fst $ app (progCompST p) 0

Compiling expressions first; building blocks.

> exprComp :: Expr -> Code
> exprComp (Val i) = [PUSH i]   -- if it's just a value, PUSH that to the stack
> exprComp (Var n) = [PUSHV n]  -- if it's a variable, PUSHV that
> exprComp (App o e p) = exprComp e ++ exprComp p ++ [DO o] -- if it's an operation, do it recursively

Compiling programs statelessly, just to get my head around the syntax we need to build

progComp :: Prog -> Label -> (Code, Label)
progComp (Assign n e) l = (exprComp e ++ [POP n], l)
progComp (Seqn []) l = ([], l)
progComp (If e p1 p2) l = (exprComp e ++ [JUMPZ 0] ++ x1 ++ [JUMP 1] ++ [LABEL 0] ++ x2 ++ [LABEL 1], y2)
                          where (x1, y1) = progComp p1 (l+2)
                                (x2, y2) = progComp p2 y1
progComp (While e p) l = ([LABEL l] ++ exprComp e ++ [JUMPZ (l+1)] ++ x ++ [JUMP l] ++ [LABEL (l+1)], y)
                          where (x,y) = progComp p (l+2)

progComp (Seqn (p:ps)) l = (x ++ x2, y2)
                            where (x,y) = progComp p l
                                  (x2,y2) = progComp (Seqn ps) y

Starting on states
Stateful computation: State -> (a, State)

Generation of new labels done here

> fresh = S(\n -> (n, n+1))

And now, compiling programs using state

> progCompST :: Prog -> ST Code
> progCompST (Assign n e) = return $ exprComp e ++ [POP n]

For a While loop: reserve 2 fresh labels; one for the beginning and one for the  end of the loop (something to jump back to at the end 
of the loop and something to skip to once the predicate's fulfilled), and compile the sub-program to be run as the body of the loop, then 
`++` it all together

> progCompST (While e p) = do lab1 <- fresh
>                             lab2 <- fresh
>                             prog1 <- progCompST p
>                             return $ [LABEL lab1] ++ exprComp e ++ [JUMPZ lab2] ++ prog1 ++ [JUMP lab1] ++ [LABEL lab2]

For If/Else: similar to While in that two labels are reserved; this time one for the second branch (the Else sub-program) and one for the end
(for the If branch to skip to once that subprogram's finished), then recursively compile the two sub-programs, then `++` everything together.

> progCompST (If e p1 p2) = do lab1 <- fresh    -- reserve a label for one branch of the statement
>                              lab2 <- fresh    -- and one for the other
>                              prog1 <- progCompST p1   -- recursive call for the body of one branch
>                              prog2 <- progCompST p2   -- another for the other
>                              return $ exprComp e ++ [JUMPZ lab1] ++ prog1 ++ [JUMP lab2] ++ [LABEL lab1] ++ prog2 ++ [LABEL lab2]

Now onto Seqn. If it's an empty Seqn, return an empty list of code. Otherwise, compile the first program in the Seqn, then recursively compile
the rest as another Seqn, then `++` it all together.

> progCompST (Seqn []) = return []
> progCompST (Seqn (p:ps)) = do prog1 <- progCompST p               -- Compile the first bit (the first instruction)
>                               progRest <- progCompST (Seqn ps)    -- Compile the rest of it
>                               return $ prog1 ++ progRest          -- Concatenate the two together

EXECUTOR CODE:------------------------------------------------------------------

exec :: Code -> Mem

> type PC = Int    -- A program counter to keep track of where I am in the code

The 'Machine': the program counter, Stack, Memory, a copy of all the code, and a list of `Int`s representing
where all the labels are (this function comes later)

> type Machine = (PC, Stack, Mem, Code, [(Label,Int)])   -- WELCOME MY SON

`run` is a function that compiles and executes the code; really just here so I don't have to keep typing in `exec (comp (fac 10))` when I want to test
something.

> run :: Prog -> Mem
> run p = exec $ comp p

Exec goes from Code to Mem, so we use the codeExec function defined above, returning only the memory

> exec :: Code -> Mem
> exec c = m
>          where (p,s,m,c',ls) = codeExec (0,[],[],c,firstPass c)

We begin by looking at the most basic parts of the Code: the Instructions.
Push takes an int and puts it at the beginning of the stack

> instPush :: Int -> Stack -> Stack
> instPush i s = i:s

PushV takes a name, looks it up in memory, and PUSHes the associated value to the stack

> instPushV :: Name -> Mem -> Stack -> Stack
> instPushV n m s = instPush (memSearch n m) s

To search the memory without going through `Maybe`s (I imagine this is a language like C where it just expects you to know what you're doing)
construct a copy of memory where the `Name` section corresponds to the name given, return the first list item and take the second part of that.

> memSearch :: Name -> Mem -> Int
> memSearch n m = snd . head $ filter (\x -> fst x == n) m

POP takes the head of the stack (an int), as well as a name, and puts it into memory as a tuple
If the stack is empty, return the memory as-is

> instPop :: Name -> Stack -> Mem -> (Stack, Mem)
> instPop n [] m = ([], m)
> instPop n s m = (tail s, (n,head s):(filter (\x -> fst x /= n) m))

`DO`ing a mathematical operation means taking the top two stack items, performing the operation
and returning the result to the head of the stack

> instDo :: Op -> Stack -> Stack
> instDo o s = case o of Add -> (y+x):newStack
>                        Sub -> (y-x):newStack
>                        Mul -> (y*x):newStack
>                        Div -> (div y x):newStack
>              where [x,y] = take 2 s
>                    newStack = drop 2 s

Jump takes a Label value, and a list of Label positions in code, and returns the index of the Label in the code

> instJump :: Label -> [(Label,Int)] -> PC
> instJump l ils = snd . head $ filter (\x -> fst x == l) ils

JumpZ takes all the things Jump does, as well as the current Stack and PC. If the head of the Stack == 0, it JUMPs using the Label value and list of Labels.
Otherwise, it increments the PC by one.

> instJumpZ :: Stack -> Label -> [(Label,Int)] -> PC -> PC
> instJumpZ s l ls p = if (head s == 0) then instJump l ls
>                                       else p+1

Putting all of these together into one function, which changes the overall state of the machine

> instExec :: Inst -> Machine -> Machine
> instExec (PUSH i) (p,s,m,c,ls) = (p+1,s',m,c,ls)                                          -- PUSH updates the stack
>                               where s' = instPush i s
> instExec (PUSHV n) (p,s,m,c,ls) = (p+1,s', m,c,ls)                                        -- Same for PUSHV
>                                where s' = instPushV n m s
> instExec (POP n) (p,s,m,c,ls) = (p+1,s', m',c,ls)                                         -- POP updates the memory and stack
>                              where (s',m') = instPop n s m
> instExec (DO o) (p,s,m,c,ls) = (p+1,s',m,c,ls)                                            -- DO updates the stack
>                             where s' = instDo o s
> instExec (LABEL l) (p,s,m,c,ls) = (p+1,s,m,c,ls)                                          -- LABEL instructions get skipped
> instExec (JUMP n) (p,s,m,c,ls) = (p',s,m,c,ls)                                            -- JUMP changes the program counter, which changes our position in the code
>                                  where p' = instJump n ls
> instExec (JUMPZ n) (p,s,m,c,ls) = (p',s,m,c,ls)                                           -- JUMPZ also changes the PC
>                                   where p' = instJumpZ s n ls p

To execute the code: if you're not at the last thing, do the next instruction, using the machine state from performing the
current instruction. If you are at the last thing, just do this one.
The intuition on that last part is that you're never going to get a JUMP as the last instruction, as the compiler (above) doesn't ever do that, and
if you're running your own generated machine code, same as `memSearch`, you should know what you're doing.

> codeExec :: Machine -> Machine
> codeExec (p,s,m,c,ls) = if p < (length c)-1 then codeExec (p',s',m',c',ls')
>                         else (p',s',m',c',ls')
>                         where (p',s',m',c',ls') = instExec (c!!p) (p,s,m,c,ls)

Generating a list of labels' positions in the code is the first pass of the executor. First, we make a function that looks at individual instructions
and updates a list of positions based on that instructions' position in the code (passed in as an argument). If the Inst passed in is a LABEL, take its
index and add it to the list of positions, else return the list of positions unchanged.

> labelPos' :: Inst -> Int -> [(Label,Int)] -> [(Label,Int)]
> labelPos' (LABEL l) i xs = (l,i):xs
> labelPos' _ i xs = xs

Applying this function over some Code, if you are at the end of the code, return the result of applying the helper to the last Inst. Otherwise, recursively
apply yourself to the remainder of the code, passing in the list of positions that results from applying the helper to the current Inst.

> labelPos :: Code -> Int -> [(Label,Int)] -> [(Label,Int)]
> labelPos (i:[]) n ls = labelPos' i n ls
> labelPos (i:is) n ls = labelPos is (n+1) $ labelPos' i n ls

As the above two functions take an index and a list of positions as arguments, as well as the Code to scan through, we need to create a function that will take
just code. This is trivially labelPos, with the Code to scan passed in as well as initial values of 0 for the index and the empty list for the list.

> firstPass :: Code -> [(Label,Int)]
> firstPass c = labelPos c 0 []
