\section{Attractive background: (Correctly drawn, animated or scrolling, complex behaviour: 3 marks)}
The background of the splash screen is a nicely rendered JPEG image.
In the 'Main' state (see later), the background scrolls left-to-right.
\vspace{5cm}
\section{Multiple states/Stages: (2 states, 3 different states/levels, polymorphic state classes: 3 marks)}
There are a total of 5 states: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item'Init', which is the splash screen and is used between levels to reset the tile manager.
  \item'Main', which is the main playing state.
  \item'Paused', which is used when the player pauses the game.
  \item'Failed', which is used when a player object collides with an enemy object.
  \item'Won', which is really just a 'next level' state, as the game is endless.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5cm}
\section{User Controlled Object: (keyboard/mouse, keyboard\&mouse+feature: 2 marks)}
The user controls the red orb, labelled 'P', using the WASD keys.
\vspace{5cm}
\section{Automated moving objects: (basic, 2 different ones, good class hierarchy: 3 marks)}
There are 2 different classes of automated moving objects:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Enemy: the blue orbs, with a very basic and naive AI functionality (discussed later). If the player touches them,
    the player loses.
  \item Friend: the green orb, which when collided with by the player, increases their score by 1000.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5cm}
\section{Moving objects and background: (interaction, 1 mark)}
No orb can go outside the area described by the red walls of the map.
\vspace{5cm}
\section{Interaction between objects: (basic/tilebased, more complex/pixel based/reliable: 2 marks)}
All the AMOs have collision detection based on Pythagoras' theorem, with the player object passively making use of this.
in order to prevent doubling of score increase etc.
\vspace{5cm}
\section{Tile Manager: (basic which changes, full with some complexity: 2 marks)}
The tile manager takes care of the map (drawing of, ensuring objects don't stray out of it), and is reactive to the
player orb passing over previously un-passed tiles, marking them with a white circle.
\vspace{5cm}
\section{Load/save: (basic high score, more complex eg maps, state: 2 marks)}
The high score of each session is maintained for as long as the session is active.
\vspace{5cm}
\section{Text: (changing text over time, more complex e.g. on displayable object: 2 marks)}
The 'score', 'tiles taken', and 'level' text change over time, and the player and enemy orbs are marked with letters
denoting what they are.
\vspace{5cm}
\section{Complex algorithm: (basic attempt, non-trivial, not simple for marker to do: 3 marks)}
Every time they move into a new tile, the enemy orbs have a 1/4 chance of moving towards the player in either axis. They
do this by considering how much above/below and left/right the player is, and move in the direction that the player is
furthest away from them in.

\section{Base engine container class: (not quite right, works properly, new feature added: 3 marks)}
\vspace{5cm}
\section{Wow factor: (nicely done, exceptional, wow!, extremely impressive/pay for: 4 marks)}
\vspace{5cm}
