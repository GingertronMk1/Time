Project title:

Using a persons' face as a game controller

Project description:

An application that will take a users' face as input (taken from a webcam or similar) and translate its movements into computer controls. The application will not be specific to controlling one program, but rather will emulate keyboard and mouse input over the OS. The project will be entirely local, not sending any data to any other device.

Scenario:


In a commercial setting, the project lead has decided that making the system connect to a server in order to 'train' the program with the face models of many users would be the best course of action. This would require that the system become 'online-only', failing if it did not have a working internet connection, as it would then have no database to go from.

Potential Ethical Issues:

Privacy:

Uploading what amounts to a CCTV feed of a users' room to a private server is a large ethical issue; the system would need to be designed with Solove's taxonomy of privacy in mind to ensure privacy for the end user.

Safety And Reliability:

It is possible that a disabled user may use the system to perform daily tasks, and without the system, they could not perform these tasks. It therefore follows that if the system becomes disabled without an internet connection, a lapse in ISP service could disrupt the end users' life. It is therefore important to ensure that the system handles this situation gracefully.
