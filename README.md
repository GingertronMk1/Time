Time
====

This repo is to be used for storage of all the coding work I do during my time at university.

It'll probably get updated once a week.

It's called Time because I've got a lot of it here (and it's a cracking album).

- AFP: Advanced Functional Programming, Haskell work
- Archived: Old modules, first year and previous semester
- CPP: C++ coursework (might not be too much in here for a while)
- IIP: Image Processing, MATLAB code
- LAC: Turns out the lecturer wants these as handwritten hard copies, so no idea what'll end up in here
