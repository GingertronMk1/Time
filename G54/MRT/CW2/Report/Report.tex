\section{Summary}
The broad idea of this project is to ensure a user is sitting properly and comfortably at their computer.
The project will use a combination of light sensors, distance sensors, and accelerometers to detect first whether or not the user is looking at their screen, and second whether or not they are craning their neck to do so in such a way as would lead to long-term damage.

\section{Background and Motivation}
Prolonged viewing of a computer screen can lead to many problems with regard to eye health, including dry eye syndrome\cite{dryeyes}, a condition in which the eyes do not produce enough tears, leading to irritation.
"Back and neck pain, headaches, and shoulder and arm pain are common computer-related injuries."\cite{vicgov}, and are related to poor posture when a user is at their workstation.
This project aims to alleviate these issues using a combination of light sensors and a 3-axis accelerometer.
The intended setting is, ultimately, in the workplace.
Many office jobs require employees to be sat at computers for large amounts of time, with no proper enforcement of regular breaks to ensure employee health.

\section{Related Work}
There is a lot of work currently centered around making computers more ergonomic and healthier to use, including standing desks, the adoption of blue light filters in software, and various monitor and laptop stands designed to raise the device screen such that the user is not craning their neck down risking damage.
