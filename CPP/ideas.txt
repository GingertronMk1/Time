Base Idea:

Pac-Man clone?

States: 
  Game Start
  Game in progress
  Game end (Win/Game Over)

Automated Moving Objects:
  Enemies (faster than you)
    1 moves towards
    1 moves randomly
  Object to grab (slower than you)
    Moves away from you

Animated Backgrounds:
  TBD
  Map

Interaction between moving objects and backgrounds
  Moving objects can't go past walls in background

Multiple moving object interaction:
  Enemies bounce off one another
  You hit enemy
you die

British Bulldog-Style game?

Rugby-style?
States:
  Start
  Try Scored
  Conversion
  End

User-Controlled Moving Object
  Arrow keys move, goes past 50% of screen background moves
  W,D to pass

Automated moving objects:
  Opposing players
    Some go for player with ball, some stay in the d-line
  Friendly players
    Push up in support
  The ball?
    

Animated backgrounds:
  The field

Interaction between AMOs and the background
  Stay inside touch-lines

Object interaction:
  Player with ball tackled -> tackle, increase tackle count
  Chance of break?


SO FAR:
--------------------------
1.  Provide Attractive Backgrounds
    1 mark so far: 1 stage has 1 background

2.  Provide Multiple States/Stages
    1 mark so far

3.  Provide a User-Controlled Moving Object (UMO)
    1 mark so far (?) pac-man style point an object that moves along that path

4.  Provide Automated Moving Objects (AMO)
    1 mark so far: a thing that moves

5.  Provide some interaction between moving objects and the background
    DONE


6.  Provide some interaction between multiple moving objects
    THIS IS THE PATH TO MARKS


7.  Provide a tile manager that reacts to changes



8.  Load/Save data



9.  Display text on the screen
    1 mark so far: text changes and provides a score


10. Change BaseEngine to use a container class rather than an array of pointers
    fuck this


11. Provide a complex algorithm/AI



12. Wow factor!
    Not gonna happen
